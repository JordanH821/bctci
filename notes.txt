Syntax Issues
- lambda functions
- enumerate provides index, value

Character Conversions
- ord(c): char to numeric code
- chr(i): numeric code to char

Strings
- Immutable in Python, JavaScript, and Java
	- Use list of characters in Python to avoid unnecessary string copies, then combine with join()
- Mutable in C++

Binary Search
- Check that initial L and R assumptions hold
	- Basically check L and R 

Indexing
- Dividing two ints with `/` will result in a float - either use `//` or cast to int
